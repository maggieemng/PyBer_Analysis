# PyBer_Analysis

### OVERVIEW OF ANALYSIS

The purpose of this analysis is to create a summary dataframe that shows ride-sharing data by types of city - Rural,Urban, or Suburban. In addition, we utilized line graphs and tables in order to visualize the data. 

### RESULTS

We noted that Urban areas have the most drivers and rides but the average fare per ride is significantlt lower

We also noted that although there is constant fluctuation, the fare for each city remains in a similatr range throughout the year and fare values for the three types of cities/locations are always in the same order

### RECOMMENDATIONS

Some business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types:
1. Also take into account gas prices and other material price changes.
2. Properly allocate types of drivers with the needs of the riders for each type of city in order to maximize operations and profit.
3. Adjust charger per mile depending on types of trips drivers are making (i.e. in NYC drivers drive shorter trips and there could be traffic vs. suburbian town no traffic and they will be driving longer distances)
